Important Notices

This software (HOLOS-EU, V5.0.0) has been primarily designed to encourage various stakeholders, including farmers, to explore existing and alternative methods for improving production, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and addressing environmental pollution. Additionally, it facilitates the accounting of carbon balance and cost-benefit analysis at a farm-to-national level. The provided estimates are approximate and may change significantly as new scientific findings emerge. University College Dublin (UCD) and the collaborative institutes do not warrant the reliability of this tool for uses at this stage other than research and education, specifically for exploring practices related to farm configuration.
